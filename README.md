The manuscript proposes a simulation model for cancer patient survival data with different immunotherapy treatments. This repository contains the source code of the [simulation model itself](model/model.cpp), which is written in C++, as well as [R scripts to call the simulation model](model/call_model_function.R) from within R. Further, there is one folder for each data figure in the paper that contains all code an (possibly) external data required to reproduce the plots shown in that figure.
